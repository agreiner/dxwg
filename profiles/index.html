      A <dfn>profile</dfn> is a named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications,
      including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes,
      semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications
      necessary to accomplish a particular function.
    </p>
	<p class="note">"Profile" here includes what are often called "application profiles", "metadata application profiles", or "metadata profiles".</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
	<div class="note">From F2F3 outline:
		<ul>
			<li>Why profiles</li>
			<li>What are they? (hint: many different things)</li>
			<li>Definition</li>
			<li>Communities, national identity on data standards, domains of activity</li>
			<li>Functions: consensus; sharing; search; etc.)</li>
			<li>Examples: ODRL, PROV, DCAT, BIBFRAME</li></ul>
	</div>
    <p>
		Builders of vocabularies and ontologies are encouraged to make their 
		work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future 
		adoption. As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a 
		data model using minimal semantics. For example, DCAT defines the 
		concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data 
		services as means of accessing that data. It is silent on whether a 
		distribution should be in a particular serialization, or set of 
		serializations; it is silent on how data services should be configured; 
		while it states that the value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS concept, 
		it does not specify a particular SKOS concept scheme, and so on. Other 
		vocabularies such as Dublin Core are equally parsimonious in their prescriptions of how they should be used.
	</p><p>
		This is good practice: it means that data models and methods of working 
		can applied in different circumstances than those in which the original 
		definition work was carried out and in that sense promotes broad 
		interoperability.
	</p><p>
		However, any individual system will be designed to meet a specific set 
		of needs, that is, it will operate in a specific context. It is that 
		context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within 
		it, that will determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be 
		used. For example, a system ingesting data may require that a specific 
		subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only 
		terms from a defined code list are used as values for specified 
		properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the 
		value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", the 
		profile will say "the value of this property MUST be from *this* 
		specific code list."
	</p>
	<p>
		The Data Exchange working Group considered a number of Use Cases where profiles form a key part of interoperability agreements within communities of practice. Many of the requirements to provide a means to use DCAT for specific applications have been identified as best dealt with through profiles specifying usage of terms from DCAT and external vocabaularies, without restricting the applicability of those vocabularies in general. Other cases for profiling include XML based data exchange and services. A general mechanism is proposed for clients of HTTP based services to negotiate choice of data content profile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Existing practices have highlighted several key factors that must be taken into consideration:
		<ol>
			<li>Profile specification is implemented using different forms of expression, including documents, and formalisms such as SHACL, Schematron etc appropriate for the specifications being profiled.</li>
			<li>A given profile may have several formalisms for sub-sets of the profile - e.g. Schema and schematron, SHACL and guidance notes etc.</li>
			<li>No existing vocabulary has been identified that addresses all needs of profile specification for all Web based platforms</li>
			<li>No existing vocabulary has been identified that captures the inherent relationships of profiles to base specifications or other profiles.</li>
			<li>Approaches to describing profiles, and guidance on creating profiles, are not standardised</li> 
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		When examining these Use Cases and requirements it is clear there are three possible scopes for considering profiles: 

		<ol>
			<li>profiles of DCAT only</li>
			<li>profiles of RDF vocabularies only</li>
			<li>general use of profiling to promote interoperability of resources on the Web</li>
		</ol>
		
		Given the motivating Use Cases are not constrained to RDF vocabularies, the appropriate scope is the general case, and a general definition of profiles has been adopted.

       <h2>Scope of Profile Guidance</h2>
	   <p>
			This document provides general guidance on the development and publication of profiles to support interoperability of resources on the Web.
	   </p>
	   <p>Guidance will be at a conceptual level, but recommendations and examples will use availabile RDF formalisms. This guidance can however be implemented in any platform that provides equivalent mechanisms to meet the requirements described.

    <p>
      The necessary standardisation of the content-negotiation headers is done within the IETF. A first proposal
      for an <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema">Internet Draft
      for Negotiating Profiles in HTTP</a> is available but has not yet been submitted to the IETF. The current
      version of the draft (-00) is expected to be completely re-written in course of the process and should not
      be seen as anything but work-in-progress.
